# Subtitle_Video

### Implemented a gradio tool where it takes an input video and font size and generate a video with subtitle.
### Install all the dependencies by running -> pip install -r requirements.txt.
### Run the main.py file and copy the public url 
### I also provide the notebook you can access that notebook as well by installing all the dependencies.
### In output_videos there are some reuslt of the video with subtitle.
### Here is the link you can refer to work with the tool and with the repo -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/11CO4P4QlJEH8PXZMLPbEr3bC4GrwLLel/view?usp=sharing
